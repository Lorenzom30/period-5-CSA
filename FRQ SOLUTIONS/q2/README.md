#question is about 

the question is about 2 teams a red and blue one or team1 and team 2 going back and forth scoring and who is more active and who end up winning between the 2 


#STRUGGLES 


struggles i had with this question was the scoring and being active ethid because it was a little confusing at first but i ended up understaning when a classmate explained it then i eventually got it correct hopfully.

#prior experiences that helped 

some prior experiences that worked or helped were again old code and code that really helped was the light bar code where it is shown by either being on as active or off nonactive or also known as false that code did help but also a classmate helped me for a better understanding.

# something learned 

what i learned was the turning on and off thing like the which team is actice or not during the play or known as code and how to manage around that and work thrugh having it as active and scoring or not active and not scoring and using a lot of booleeans ro make it happen.
