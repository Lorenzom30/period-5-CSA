this question is about a bird feeder where there is a bird feeder that holds food for birds and gets significantlly lower over the days and if there is a low drop of food then it has been only eaten by birds but when there is a huge difference between the food from one day to the other then it would outputed that a bear has eaten the food from the feeder 



#struggles 

the struggle with the question was the actual calculation part because i was able to get the heading code but when it got to the calculation and how i should work it i was struggling a little bit

#prior experiences that helped 
Some prior experience that helped was old code that i looked at that had alot of math calculations and different ways used.But majority old codes have helped me alot just going back and looking at them.

#what i learned 
what I learned by doing this question was not everything is fast paced and that it needs to be thoughtout well and planned with no rush otherwise i would lose focus and also to understand the calculations of the problem and to look at the graph they give you.
