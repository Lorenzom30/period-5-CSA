# question is about 

this question is about checking if the word is in the list and checking the word in the list beofre it is in the current word.

# struggles 

some struggles i had were connectng the word sizze and indexof together because i would switch them up like in size i would accidentally put word and leave indexof with jjust closed brackets 

# experiences that helped 
some that helped was getting it broken down so that way i understand it better and also using old code because there are old codes that we did similar to this that had same exact codeing

# what i learned 
i learned that this code was mainly based off of being boolean like a true or false then anything else and that at first it seemed hard until i actually broke it dowm more and did it step by step
